# Unified Service Orchestrator Platform

The Unified Service Orchestrator Platform (USOP) is designed to orchestrate services under a single platform using Kubernetes, Helm charts, and Django.

## Key Features

- **Kubernetes-based Architecture**: The platform is built on top of Kubernetes, providing a robust and scalable container orchestration system.
- **Helm Chart Integration**: Helm charts are used to package and deploy services, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments.
- **Django-powered Management Interface**: The platform provides a user-friendly Django-based web interface for managing and monitoring the deployed services.
- **Multicloud Support**: The platform can orchestrate services across multiple cloud providers, including public and private clouds.
- **Automated Provisioning**: The platform automates the provisioning of new services, reducing the manual effort required for deployment.
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: The platform includes comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities to ensure the health and performance of the deployed services.
- **Scalability and High Availability**: The platform is designed to scale up or down based on the demand, ensuring high availability of the managed services.

## Technology Stack

- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform for managing and scaling the deployed services.
- **Helm**: Package manager for deploying and managing Kubernetes applications.
- **Django**: Python web framework for the management interface and API.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing platform-related data.
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring and alerting system for the deployed services.
- **Grafana**: Data visualization and dashboard tool for monitoring.
